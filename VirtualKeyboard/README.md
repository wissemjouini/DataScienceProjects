# Virtual Keyboard Project
This project is a virtual keyboard that can be controlled using hand gestures. The user can move their hand over the keyboard and select keys by touching them with their index finger.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

cv2
cvzone
pynput
You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install opencv-python
pip install cvzone
pip install pynput

## Usage
To use the virtual keyboard, run the virtual_keyboard.py file. A window will open showing the virtual keyboard. Move your hand over the keyboard and touch the keys you want to press with your index finger. The selected keys will be highlighted in green, and the text you type will appear in the text area at the bottom of the screen.

To delete a character, touch the "DEL" button with your index finger and hold it for a moment. The last character you typed will be deleted from the text area.

To quit the program, press the "q" key on your keyboard or click the "x" button in the top right corner of the window.
