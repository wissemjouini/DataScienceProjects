# Computer Vision Projects
This repository contains 5 computer vision projects that demonstrate the power of AI and image processing techniques. The projects are:

AI Painter: A deep learning model that generates beautiful paintings from input photos.
Find Number Game: A computer vision game that challenges players to find and click on the correct number within a set time limit.
Virtual Keyboard: A hand gesture recognition system that allows users to type on a virtual keyboard without touching a physical keyboard.
Virtual Drag and Drop: A computer vision system that enables users to drag and drop virtual objects using hand gestures.
Hand Finger Detection and Calculating: A real-time hand gesture recognition and tracking system that detects the position and movement of individual fingers.
Each project has its own directory, containing source code, models, and data files. The projects were implemented using Python and various computer vision libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow.

Feel free to explore the code and try out the projects yourself!
