# Introduction
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and analyze visual data from the world around them. It has numerous applications in areas such as object recognition, face detection, and motion tracking.

In this repository, you will find several computer vision projects that demonstrate various aspects of this exciting field. These projects cover a range of topics, from hand gesture recognition to virtual keyboards.

# Projects
Hand Finger Detection and Counting
This project uses computer vision to detect and count the number of fingers held up by the user's hand. It utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand detection and landmark tracking.

## AI Painter
The AI Painter project uses deep learning techniques to create an AI-powered painting application. The model is trained on a dataset of various paintings and uses a convolutional neural network to generate new images in a similar style.

## Find Number Game
The Find Number Game project is a simple game that challenges players to find hidden numbers within an image. It uses image processing techniques to generate the game board and identify the location of the hidden numbers.

## Virtual Keyboard
The Virtual Keyboard project uses computer vision to detect the position of the user's hands and translate their movements into keyboard inputs. This allows users to type on a virtual keyboard without the need for a physical keyboard.

## Virtual Drag and Drop
The Virtual Drag and Drop project is an application that allows users to drag and drop virtual objects using hand gestures. It uses computer vision techniques to detect the position of the user's hand and translate their movements into object movements.

# Conclusion
These computer vision projects demonstrate the potential of this exciting field and highlight some of the innovative applications that can be built using computer vision techniques. We hope that these projects inspire you to explore this field further and build your own projects using these techniques.

Feel free to explore the code and try out the projects yourself!
